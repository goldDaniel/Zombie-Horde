# Zombie-Horde
Zombie horde is a game I created in high school.
This project was made for my final project, and was used to enter the University of Manitoba CompSci High School Fair.
The Project won me first place, and I got to take a nice shiny trophy home for the weekend.

There is no chance for me to update this codebase, as it is older and is pretty slopy by my current standards.
I keep it here because it is a project I greatly value, as it was the first "game" I ever created.

It is written in Java, using no external libraries.
